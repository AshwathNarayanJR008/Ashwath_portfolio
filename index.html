									<h3>Projects</h3>
									<p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve had the privilege of working on innovative projects that reflect my passion for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and their real-world applications. These projects allowed me to solve complex problems, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and explore advanced technologies.<br>
										<br>
										Each project showcases my ability to integrate AI and ML models with modern technologies like IoT, cloud computing, and big data analytics. From healthcare to engineering, these projects illustrate my commitment to using data-driven solutions to address industry-specific challenges.</p>

												<h4>A Deep Neural Network Approach for Automated Blood Vessel Segmentation, Noise Reduction, and 3D Reconstruction in Ultrasound Images</h4>
												<h6>Current MSc Dissertation Project</h6>
												<p> My Master's dissertation aims to develop AI-based segmentation model for automatic detection of blood vessel in ultrasound images. The model learns to differentiate between the region of interest (blood vessel) and the background by training on labeled ultrasound images. The ultimate goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis, reducing the manual effort required by radiologists and assisting in early diagnosis.</p>

												<h4>HeartSync: A Vision-Based Real-Time Vital Signs Monitoring System</h4>
												<p> The project uses a webcam to estimate vital signs like heart rate, 
													respiratory rate, and body temperature in real-time. It uses computer vision and signal processing techniques 
													to detect physiological cues and computes BPM and RPM using Fast Fourier Transform. The system has a modular 
													Python-based GUI for user interaction and is suitable for home-based health tracking and telemedicine. It also 
													includes cloud-based data logging via Google Sheets and is adaptable to mobile platforms. Future work will focus 
													on clinical validation, stress level prediction, and SpO₂ estimation.</p>

												<h4>BrainMap AI: Hybrid System for Brain Tumour Detection and Segmentation</h4>
												<p> This project combines supervised and unsupervised learning to detect and segment brain tumours from MRI images without labeled data. A ResNet-18 model classifies brain MRI scans into four views and identifies tumour presence. When a tumour is detected, unsupervised clustering methods (K-means and fuzzy C-means) segment the tumour regions. Two user-friendly GUIs handle classification and segmentation, and the results, along with patient details, are automatically emailed to physicians—making diagnosis easier and more efficient. </p>

												<h4>Early Prediction of Heart Failure using Machine Learning</h4>
												<p> The project aims to support early diagnosis and intervention for heart failure patients using artificial intelligence. A heart failure dataset was thoroughly analyzed and preprocessed to ensure data quality. Six different machine learning models were trained and evaluated, with logistic regression selected as the final model due to its strong performance (around 90% in accuracy, precision, and recall). To make the system accessible in clinical environments, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed, allowing healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive instant predictive results. This project demonstrates how AI can enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes in cardiovascular healthcare. </p>

												<h4>Smart Non-Invasive Health Monitoring for Glucose</h4>
												<p>This project focused on building a real-time health monitoring system using wearable 
													IoT devices to gather patient data non-invasively. A key feature was the development of a
													glucose identification model, which accurately detected blood glucose levels without 
													invasive methods, offering a convenient solution for diabetic patients. Machine learning 
													algorithms processed the data to provide actionable insights, enabling healthcare providers to 
													make more informed decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the strain on 
													traditional healthcare resources.</p>

												<h4>Face and Action Detection for Crime Prevention</h4>
												<p> In this project a novel face and action detection technology for crime
													prevention and public security was developed. The technology uses real-time capabilities
													to reduce response times and identify signs of aggression. However,
													ethical concerns about privacy and potential discrimination need to be
													addressed. The project aims to use computer vision and data analytics to
													detect human faces and violent actions in videos. The paper emphasizes
													the potential of these technologies in ensuring public safety, but calls for
													cautious and ethical implementation.</p>
